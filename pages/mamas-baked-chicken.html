            <p> This recipe is a personal favorite, and by "a personal favorite" I really mean 
                <strong>"my personal favorite."</strong> It's the best. Buttery,
                crusty, and a little bit <em>smoky</em>, this chicken bake will burn the roof 
                of your mouth, for better or worse!
            </p>

            <p> To begin, gather the necessary ingredients.
            </p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2 chicken breasts</li>
                        <li>4 cups bread crumbs</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup salted butter</li>
                        <li>2 tblsp. lemon juice</li>
                        <li>2 tsp. garlic salt</li>
                        <li>2 tsp. garlic powder</li>
                        <li>3 tsp. chipotle powder</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup Parmesan</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

            <h2>Steps to Make</h2>

            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>If you don't have premade breadcrumbs (which is actually ideal), 
                        dry 5-6 slices of bread in your oven at 225 degrees F, then process 
                        them briskly in a food processor. Sift out smaller
                        crumbs as needed to process the larger ones. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Do not use convection bake 
                        or you will burn the bread crumbs!
                    </li>
                    <li>Mix bread crumbs with garlic salt, garlic powder, chipotle powder, and 
                        Parmsesan.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add thawed chicken to a pyrex baking dish. Cover and stuff crannies 
                        with freshly seasoned crumbs.
                    </li>
                    <li>Melt the butter then mix with lemon juice. Drizzle across the chicken.</li>
                    <li>Bake approx. 1 hour or until 175 degrees F. Cover with foil if the 
                        crumbs are blackening too quickly.
                    </li>
                    <li>Enjoy with carrots and noodles on the side!</li>
                </ol>
